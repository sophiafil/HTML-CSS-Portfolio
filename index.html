				<h2>Little Intorduction</h2>
				<p>I'm currently a student at the University of North Florida obtaining a B.S in Information Science with a minor in Mathematics for Non-math Majors. Currently, I am looking for internships related to user interface design, user experience design, and/or product design. I have experience in graphic design, wireframming, and prototyping, and I have skills dealing with leadership, facilitation, and community. Please check out my "About Me" for a more information about me!</p>

					<h2>Outside of my major and career</h2>
						<p>I do many activities outside of my major and career! In my free time, I do digitial and tradional art, cook and bake (mostly banana bread), animate, play video games (mostly Nintendo games), and roller skate! I am the creator and president of a brand new club at the Universty of North Florida called Osprey Rolling Crew where I've created a community of 20+ college students who roller skate or roller blade. If I'm not doing any of these, then I am spending time with my green-cheek conure named Everest and my shih tzu named Juno.</p>
